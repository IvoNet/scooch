Is a Powerpoint / KeyNote slide show app but then in the browser.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

# Usage

```bash
npm start
```
open a browser at [localhost](http://localhost:3000)

Other commands:
* `browse` will open chrome on a Mac with correct url.
* `run` will combine `browse` and `npm start`
* `npm start` will build new model.json and start the server
* `build` build the new model.json

## model.json

generated during the build process and contains all data needed to work.

## Love / Hate

I love giving presentations but hate the presentation tools we currently utilize.
This is my antidote.

## Markdown

This tool utilizes markdown as the notation markup.
This makes making slides easy.
